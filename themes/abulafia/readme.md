### simple setup

this is the "abulafia" theme, it is mainly based on the nicholas default theme, but i will improve it from time to time.<br><br>
life demo here: https://slexyt.cf/blog/<br><br>
to set it up properly, you need to go to the main "config.php" file and change the `frontend_theme` from "default" to "abulafia".<br><br>
by default the banner image is a beautiful night-sky in the anime-style. to change it, navigate to `themes/abulafia/header.php` and change in the `<img>` tag the `src="your-new-banner.png"` or what so ever your file is called.<br>
keep in mind that it does not auto-resize heights, only width!<br><br>
to-do:
- get this freaking banner image stopping to get the margin/padding! I DON'T KNOW HOW xdddddd
- change `<a>` color and `:hover` style somehow, what i tried doesn't work :/
- auto-resize banner image someday... not high priority
- padding of the home-page does not match with the padding on viewing an entry??? wtf
- idk so much more i want to do...
